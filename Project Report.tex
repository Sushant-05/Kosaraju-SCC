\chapter*{Abstract}
This project implements Kosaraju's algorithm for detecting Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in directed graphs. Strongly Connected Components are fundamental structures in graph theory that represent maximal subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The algorithm employs a two-pass Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with linear time complexity $O(V + E)$, making it highly efficient for large-scale graph analysis. We present the theoretical foundation, implementation details, complexity analysis, and experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The algorithm demonstrates excellent scalability and correctness across various graph structures.




\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Problem Statement}
In directed graph theory, a Strongly Connected Component (SCC) is defined as a maximal subgraph where there exists a directed path from any vertex to any other vertex within the component. The problem addressed in this project is to efficiently identify all such components in a given directed graph.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach and Methodology: Kosaraju's algorithm}


Kosaraju's algorithm is a linear-time algorithm that uses two passes of Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify SCCs. The algorithm consists of three main phases:

\subsubsection{Key Functions}


\textbf{DFS-First}: Performs DFS on original graph, pushing vertices to stack when finished.\\
\textbf{Transpose}: Creates $G^T$ where all edges are reversed\\
\textbf{DFS-Second}: Performs DFS on transpose graph to discover SCCs

\section{Theoretical Foundation}

The finishing times in DFS help identify "sink" components.The transpose graph preserves SCCs while reversing reachability relationships.Processing vertices in decreasing order of finishing time from the first DFS ensures we discover SCCs in the correct order

\section{Proof of correctness}
\subsection{Key Lemmas}

\begin{lemma}[SCC Preservation under Transposition]
The strongly connected components of $G$ and $G^T$ are identical.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For any two vertices $u, v \in V$:

If $u$ and $v$ are in the same SCC in $G$, then there exists paths $u \to v$ and $v \to u$ in $G$. In $G^T$, these paths become $v \to u$ and $u \to v$ respectively. Therefore, $u$ and $v$ are in the same SCC in $G^T$.

The converse follows by symmetry since $(G^T)^T = G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Finishing Time Ordering]
Let $C$ and $C'$ be two distinct SCCs in $G$, and suppose there is a path from $C$ to $C'$ in the component graph $G^{SCC}$. Then the maximum finishing time in the first DFS of any vertex in $C$ is greater than the maximum finishing time of any vertex in $C'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider two cases:

\textbf{Case 1:} DFS first visits a vertex in $C$ before any vertex in $C'$. Since there's a path from $C$ to $C'$, all of $C'$ will be explored during the DFS call that started in $C$. Therefore, all vertices in $C'$ will finish before the DFS call that started the exploration of $C$ completes. Thus, $\max\_finish(C) > \max\_finish(C')$.

\textbf{Case 2:} DFS first visits a vertex in $C'$ before any vertex in $C$. Since there's no path from $C'$ to $C$ (otherwise $C$ and $C'$ would be the same SCC), the DFS starting in $C'$ cannot reach $C$. Later, when DFS visits $C$, it will explore $C$ completely. Therefore, $\max\_finish(C) > \max\_finish(C')$.

In both cases, the lemma holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Processing Order in Second DFS]
When processing vertices in decreasing order of finishing times from the first DFS on the transpose graph $G^T$, each DFS tree discovered corresponds exactly to one SCC of $G$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $v$ be a vertex popped from the stack (highest finishing time), and let $C$ be the SCC containing $v$ in $G$.

From Lemma 2, for any SCC $C'$ reachable from $C$ in $G^T$, we have $\max\_finish(C) \geq \max\_finish(C')$ in the original graph.

But in $G^T$, edges between SCCs are reversed. So if $C'$ is reachable from $C$ in $G^T$, then in the original graph $G$, $C$ is reachable from $C'$.

From Lemma 2, this means $\max\_finish(C') \geq \max\_finish(C)$ in the original graph.

Combining both inequalities: $\max\_finish(C') = \max\_finish(C)$

However, by the maximality of SCCs and the properties of DFS, all vertices with the same maximum finishing time must belong to the same SCC.

Therefore, the DFS starting at $v$ in $G^T$ will explore exactly the SCC $C$ and no other SCCs.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Main Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Correctness of Kosaraju's Algorithm]
Kosaraju's algorithm correctly computes all strongly connected components of a directed graph $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove by induction on the number of SCCs processed.

\textbf{Base Case:} When the stack is empty, all vertices have been processed.

\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} Assume that after processing $k$ SCCs, all SCCs discovered so far are correct, and no vertex from an undiscovered SCC has been incorrectly included.

\textbf{Inductive Step:} Consider the next vertex $v$ popped from the stack that hasn't been visited in the second DFS.

Let $C$ be the SCC of $v$ in $G$. We need to show that the DFS starting from $v$ in $G^T$ discovers exactly $C$.

\textbf{Part 1: DFS discovers all vertices in $C$}
By Lemma 1, $C$ is also an SCC in $G^T$. Since DFS explores all reachable vertices from $v$ in $G^T$, it will discover all vertices in $C$.

\textbf{Part 2: DFS discovers only vertices in $C$}
Suppose for contradiction that the DFS discovers a vertex $w \notin C$. Then there are two cases:

\textbf{Case A:} $w$ is in an SCC $C'$ that has a path to $C$ in $G^T$. Then in the original graph $G$, there is a path from $C$ to $C'$. By Lemma 2, $\max\_finish(C) > \max\_finish(C')$ in the original graph. But $w$ was not visited before $v$ was popped, meaning $finish(w) < finish(v)$. This contradicts that $v$ has the maximum finishing time in $C$.

\textbf{Case B:} $w$ is in an SCC $C'$ that has no path to/from $C$ in $G^T$. Then $C$ and $C'$ are disconnected components in $G^T$. But DFS starting at $v$ cannot reach $w$ since there's no path. Contradiction.

Therefore, the DFS starting at $v$ discovers exactly the SCC $C$.

By induction, the algorithm correctly identifies all SCCs.
\end{proof}

\newpage
\subsection{Detailed Step-by-Step Proof}

\subsubsection{Phase 1: First DFS on Original Graph}

\begin{claim}
The stack contains vertices in decreasing order of finishing times.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the DFS algorithm - vertices are pushed onto the stack when their DFS call completes, so earlier finishing vertices are deeper in the stack.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
For any two SCCs $C_i$ and $C_j$, if there is a path from $C_i$ to $C_j$ in the component graph, then $\max\_finish(C_i) > \max\_finish(C_j)$.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
This is Lemma 2.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Transpose Graph Construction}

\begin{claim}
$G$ and $G^T$ have the same SCCs.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
This is Lemma 1.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
In $G^T$, the edges between SCCs are reversed compared to $G$.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
If there's an edge from $C_i$ to $C_j$ in $G$, then by definition there exist $u \in C_i$, $v \in C_j$ with $(u, v) \in E$. Then $(v, u) \in E^T$, so there's an edge from $C_j$ to $C_i$ in $G^T$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Second DFS on Transpose Graph}

\begin{claim}
When we pop a vertex $v$ from the stack, if it hasn't been visited in the second DFS, then the DFS starting from $v$ in $G^T$ discovers exactly one SCC.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
Let $C$ be the SCC of $v$. We need to show:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item All vertices in $C$ are discovered
    \item No vertices outside $C$ are discovered
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof of (a):} Since $C$ is strongly connected in $G$, it's also strongly connected in $G^T$ (by Lemma 1). Therefore, starting from any vertex in $C$ in $G^T$, we can reach all other vertices in $C$.

\textbf{Proof of (b):} Suppose the DFS discovers a vertex $w \notin C$. Let $C'$ be the SCC of $w$.

Since the DFS discovered $w$ from $v$, there must be a path from $v$ to $w$ in $G^T$. This means there's a path from $w$ to $v$ in the original graph $G$.

Now, consider the finishing times. Since $v$ was popped before $w$ (because $w$ wasn't visited yet), we have $finish(v) > finish(w)$ in the first DFS.

But if there's a path from $w$ to $v$ in $G$, then during the first DFS, when we visited $w$, we would have also visited $v$ (unless $v$ was already visited). This would mean $finish(v) < finish(w)$ or they would be in the same SCC.

This leads to a contradiction unless $v$ and $w$ are in the same SCC, which they're not by assumption.

Therefore, no such $w$ exists.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Completeness and Termination Proofs}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
Kosaraju's algorithm discovers every vertex exactly once in some SCC.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $v$ be any vertex in $V$. We show $v$ is included in exactly one output component.

\textbf{Existence:} In the first DFS, $v$ is pushed onto the stack. In the second DFS, when $v$ is popped from the stack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $v$ hasn't been visited, it starts a new DFS that includes it
    \item If $v$ has been visited, it was included in some previous DFS
\end{itemize}
In either case, $v$ is included in some output component.

\textbf{Uniqueness:} Suppose for contradiction that $v$ is included in two different output components $C_1$ and $C_2$. This would mean there were two different DFS calls in the second phase that both included $v$. But this is impossible because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Once a vertex is visited in the second DFS, it's marked and cannot be visited again
    \item Each DFS call in the second phase processes only unvisited vertices
\end{itemize}
Therefore, each vertex appears in exactly one output component.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Termination]
Kosaraju's algorithm terminates for any finite graph.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
All three phases involve finite operations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{First DFS:} Processes each vertex and edge exactly once
    \item \textbf{Transpose Construction:} Iterates over each vertex and edge exactly once  
    \item \textbf{Second DFS:} Processes each vertex and edge exactly once
\end{enumerate}
Since the graph is finite ($|V| < \infty$ and $|E| < \infty$), each phase terminates in finite time.
\end{proof}


\chapter{Complexity Analysis}
\section{Time Complexity}

The time complexity of Kosaraju's algorithm is $O(V + E)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is the number of vertices
    \item $E$ is the number of edges
\end{itemize}
Kosaraju's algorithm consists of three main phases. The time complexity of this algorithm can be analyzed by examining each of its major steps.\\

In the first phase, a DFS is performed on the original graph to record the finishing times of all vertices. Since each vertex and each edge of the graph is visited exactly once during this traversal, the time required for this step is (O(V + E)). The second phase constructs the transpose of the graph, i.e., a new graph in which every edge ((u, v)) in (G) is replaced by ((v, u)). This can be achieved by iterating over every vertex and its adjacency list once, which again takes (O(V + E)) time using an adjacency list representation. In the final phase, another DFS is performed on the transposed graph, processing vertices in decreasing order of their finishing times obtained from the first DFS. This second DFS also visits each vertex and edge exactly once, taking (O(V + E)) time.\\

Since the three phases are executed sequentially and each takes linear time in the size of the graph, the total running time of Kosaraju’s algorithm is (O(V + E)). The algorithm also requires space proportional to the size of the input graph for storing the original and transposed adjacency lists, as well as (O(V)) additional space for the stack and the visited array. Thus, both the time and space complexities of Kosaraju’s algorithm are (O(V + E)).


\section{Space Complexity}
The space complexity of Kosaraju’s algorithm arises primarily from storing the graph, its transpose, and the auxiliary data structures used during the two depth-first searches. The input graph (G = (V, E)) is typically represented using an adjacency list, which requires (O(V + E)) space—(O(V)) for the list headers of all vertices and (O(E))  for storing all adjacency links corresponding to the directed edges. During the second step of the algorithm, a transposed version of the graph is constructed by reversing every edge. This transposed graph also takes (O(V + E)) space, as it contains the same number of vertices and edges as the original graph.\\

In addition to the two graph structures, the algorithm maintains several auxiliary data structures. The visited array, used to track whether a vertex has been explored during DFS, requires (O(V)) space. A stack is also maintained to store the vertices in the order of their finishing times during the first DFS; this stack can hold at most (V) elements, contributing another (O(V)) space. The recursive calls made by DFS add an implicit recursion stack that, in the worst case, can also grow to (O(V)) depth if the graph contains a long directed path.\\

Combining these contributions, the total space used by Kosaraju’s algorithm is dominated by the space required to store both the original and transposed graphs, along with the auxiliary structures. Hence, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is (O(V + E)).

\chapter{Implementation Details}

We use adjacency list representation for efficient memory usage and traversal.\\
\textbf{Maximality Property}: A component $C$ is \textbf{maximal} if no additional vertices from $V \setminus C$ can be added to $C$ while maintaining strong connectivity.
\section{Mathematical Formulation}

For a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, the SCCs form a partition of $V$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each SCC is strongly connected
    \item The SCCs are disjoint: 
    $$\bigcup_{i} C_i = V \text{ and } C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset \text{ for } i \neq j$$
    \item The \textbf{component graph} $G^{SCC}$ is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SCC Decomposition}: Every directed graph can be uniquely decomposed into strongly connected components, and the quotient graph formed by contracting each SCC to a single vertex is a DAG.
\textbf{Finishing Time Property}: Let $C$ and $C'$ be two distinct SCCs in a directed graph $G$. If there is an edge from $C$ to $C'$ in the component graph, then the maximum finishing time in $C$ is greater than the maximum finishing time in $C'$.


\begin{proof}
Consider the first DFS traversal. If the DFS enters $C$ before $C'$, it will finish all vertices in $C$ before moving to $C'$. If it enters $C'$ first, but there's an edge from $C$ to $C'$, then the DFS must backtrack through $C$, causing later finishing times in $C$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Transpose Graph Property}: The transpose graph $G^T = (V, E^T)$ where $E^T = \{(v, u) : (u, v) \in E\}$ has exactly the same SCCs as the original graph $G$.


\begin{proof}
If $u$ and $v$ are in the same SCC in $G$, then there exist paths $u \to  v$ and $v \to  u$. In $G^T$, these become $v \to  u$ and $u \to  v$, maintaining strong connectivity.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithm Steps with Mathematical Formulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{First DFS Pass}: 
    \begin{equation}
    \text{DFS}_1(v): \text{Compute finishing times } f(v) \text{ for all } v \in V
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Graph Transposition}:
    \begin{equation}
    G^T = (V, E^T) \text{ where } E^T = \{(v, u) : (u, v) \in E\}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Second DFS Pass}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{DFS}_2(v): \text{Explore } G^T \text{ in decreasing order of } f(v)
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Code Implementation Analysis}

\subsection{Graph Class Architecture}

The implementation uses an object-oriented approach with the \texttt{Graph} class encapsulating all graph operations and algorithms.

\subsubsection{Initialization Method}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def __init__(self, vertices):
    self.V = vertices
    self.graph = [[] for _ in range(vertices)]
    self.transpose = [[] for _ in range(vertices)]
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Edge Addition and Transpose Construction}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def add_edge(self, u, v):
    self.graph[u].append(v)

def build_transpose(self):
    for u in range(self.V):
        for v in self.graph[u]:
            self.transpose[v].append(u)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Time Complexity Analysis:}
\begin{align*}
\text{add\_edge}(u,v) &= O(1) \quad \text{(Amortized)} \\
\text{build\_transpose}() &= O(|V| + |E|) \\
\text{Edge reversal} &= \text{Iterate through all edges}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Depth-First Search Implementations}

\subsubsection{Recursive DFS Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def dfs_first(self, v, visited, stack):
    visited[v] = True
    for neighbor in self.graph[v]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            self.dfs_first(neighbor, visited, stack)
    stack.append(v)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Iterative DFS Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def dfs_first_iterative(self, v, visited, stack):
    dfs_stack = [v]
    visited[v] = True
    while dfs_stack:
        current = dfs_stack[-1]
        found_unvisited = False
        for neighbor in self.graph[current]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                dfs_stack.append(neighbor)
                found_unvisited = True
                break
        if not found_unvisited:
            finished_vertex = dfs_stack.pop()
            stack.append(finished_vertex)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Advantages of Iterative Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoids Python recursion limit (typically 1000)
    \item Better memory control for large graphs
    \item Same asymptotic complexity: $O(|V| + |E|)$
\end{itemize}

                        return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Validation Logic:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each SCC with size $> 1$, verify all vertex pairs $(u,v)$
    \item Check mutual reachability: $u \to  v$ and $v \to  u$
    \item Single-vertex components are trivially strongly connected
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reachability Checking}

        return True
    visited = [False] * self.V

    return False

\textbf{Complexity per check:} $O(|V| + |E|)$ \\
\textbf{Total validation complexity:} $O(k (|V| + |E|))$ where $k$ is number of pairs checked

\section{Graph Generation Strategies}

    for u in range(vertices):
        for v in range(vertices):

                graph.add_edge(u, v)
    return graph
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Expected Number of Edges:}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[|E|] = \text{edge\_density} \times |V| \times (|V| - 1)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each possible edge included independently with probability $p$
    \item Expected SCC structure depends on edge density
    \item High density: One giant SCC likely
    \item Low density: Many small SCCs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structured Graph Generation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def generate_graph_with_scc(vertices, scc_sizes):
    graph = Graph(vertices)
    vertex_index = 0
    for size in scc_sizes:
        component_vertices = list(range(vertex_index, vertex_index + size))
        for i in range(len(component_vertices)):
            u = component_vertices[i]
            v = component_vertices[(i + 1) % len(component_vertices)]
            graph.add_edge(u, v)
        vertex_index += size
    # Add cross-component edges
    for u in range(vertices):
        for v in range(vertices):
            if u != v and random.random() < 0.1:
                graph.add_edge(u, v)
    return graph
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Construction Strategy:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create cycles for each specified SCC size
    \item Ensure internal strong connectivity
    \item Add random edges between components
    \item Maintain known ground truth for validation
\end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Second DFS Pass:}

The enumeration of these three experiments do not correspond to the mentioned experiments in the excel sheet. We have done the runtime and memory analysis on randomly generated graphs of various sizes. The second experiment validates the algorithm validation through naive approaches. Section 4.2 has more information on it.

\subsubsection{Experiment 2: Correctness Validation}

We validated correctness through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual verification on small graphs (V $\leq$ 10)
    \item Comparison with known SCC structures
    \item Property checking within each SCC
\end{itemize}

All tests confirmed 100\% accuracy in SCC detection.

\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\section{Performance Analysis}

The experimental results demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Scaling}: Runtime scales linearly with $V + E$, confirming theoretical complexity
    \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Adjacency list representation minimizes memory usage
    \item \textbf{Real-world Applicability}: Algorithm handles large-scale graphs efficiently
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correctness and Validation}

Our implementation correctly identifies SCCs across all test cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Verified on synthetic graphs with known SCC structure
    \item Validated through manual inspection of small graphs
    \item Confirmed through reachability checks within components
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Observations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recursion Depth}: Very large graphs may exceed Python's recursion limit (solved using iterative DFS)
    \item \textbf{Memory Usage}: Dense graphs require significant memory for adjacency lists
    \item \textbf{Real-world Patterns}: Web graphs typically exhibit one giant SCC and many small components
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges and Lessons Learned}
\subsection{Technical Challenges}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Recursion Limits}: Large graphs caused stack overflow
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Solution}: Implemented iterative DFS using explicit stacks(although in the code we have used sys module to increase the recursion limit since calling the other function every time would have required a change every time and our laptops can handle the computations)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Memory Management}: Handling very large graphs efficiently
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Solution}: Optimized data structures and garbage collection
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Learnings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The importance of choosing appropriate graph representations
    \item How theoretical complexity translates to practical performance
    \item The elegance of divide-and-conquer in graph algorithms
    \item Practical considerations for handling large-scale data
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Conclusion}
We successfully implemented Kosaraju's algorithm for detecting Strongly Connected Components in directed graphs. The algorithm demonstrates excellent performance with $O(V + E)$ time and space complexity, making it suitable for large-scale graph analysis. Our implementation correctly identifies SCCs across various graph structures and scales linearly with graph size.

The project provided valuable insights into graph algorithm design, complexity analysis, and practical implementation challenges. The algorithm's efficiency and correctness make it a powerful tool for network analysis in various domains.

\section{Future Work}

    \item Extend to dynamic graphs where edges change over time
    \item Compare with Tarjan's and path-based algorithms
